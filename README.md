🧑‍💻 Predicting Global Video Game Sales Using Data-Driven Insights
📌 Project Summary
The video game industry is highly competitive, and predicting a game's sales success is challenging.
This project analyzes sales data from 1980 to 2020 and builds a regression model to estimate global sales based on regional performance, platform, genre, and release information.

This project applies Multiple Linear Regression to predict global video game sales using historical industry data. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven models can help publishers and developers make informed business decisions.

🎯 Key Objectives
Analyze historical video game sales trends
Identify important factors affecting global sales
Build an accurate and interpretable regression model
Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

▶️ Steps to Use the Model
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-game-sales-prediction.git
cd video-game-sales-prediction
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Ensure Python is installed, then run:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit
Step 3: Run the Notebook
Global Video Game Sales
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Run all cells to load data, preprocess it, and train the model
Step 4: Train and Save the Model
After training, the model is saved as:

text
model.pkl
Step 5: Load the Model for Prediction
python
import pickle

model = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", "rb"))
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print(prediction)
Step 6: Deploy the Model (Optional)
Push the complete repository to GitHub
Create a UI using Streamlit
Run or deploy the app
streamlit run app.py
Step 7: Use the Application
Enter game details such as platform, genre, and regional sales
Get predicted Global Video Game Sales output
